# Azure core client library for iOS

This is the core framework for the Azure SDK for iOS, containing the HTTP pipeline, as well as a shared set of
components that are used across all client libraries, including pipeline policies, error types, type aliases, an XML
Codable implementation, and a logging system. As an end user, you don't need to manually install AzureCore because it
will be installed automatically when you install other SDK libraries. If you are a client library developer, please
reference the [AzureStorageBlob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/master/sdk/storage/AzureStorageBlob)
library as an example of how to use the shared AzureCore components in your client library.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* The client library is written in modern Swift 5. Due to this, Xcode 10.2 or higher is required to use this library.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to use this library.

### Install the library
At the present time, to install the Azure core client library for iOS you must download the latest
[release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases) and integrate it into your project manually:

#### Manually integrate the library into your project

To manually integrate this library into your project, first download the latest releases of the following libraries from
the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases) page:

* `AzureCore.framework`

Extract the .frameworks to your project's "Frameworks" folder. Select your project in Xcode's Project navigator, and
then select the desired target in the Targets list. Drag & drop the .frameworks from your project's "Frameworks" folder
into the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.

> Note: To include debug symbols for these frameworks in your project, download the corresponding `dSYM` archives,
> extract them to a location within your project directory, and add a Build Phase to your project that will copy them to
> your Products Directory when installing.

If you plan to use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for iOS](http://aka.ms/aadv2) in your project, add it by
following the library's
[installation instructions](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc#installation).

## Key concepts

The main shared concepts of AzureCore (and thus, Azure SDK libraries using AzureCore) include:

- Configuring service clients, e.g. policies, logging (`HeadersPolicy` et al., `ClientLogger`).
- Accessing HTTP response details (`HTTPResponse`, `HTTPResultHandler<T>`).
- Paging and asynchronous streams (`PagedCollection<T>`).
- Exceptions for reporting errors from service requests in a consistent fashion. (`AzureError`, `HTTPResponseError`).
- Abstractions for representing Azure SDK credentials. (`AccessToken`).
