# AzurePush

![Current State: Requirements](https://img.shields.io/badge/Current_State-Requirements-red.svg)

[AzurePush API Reference](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/AzurePush) and [samples](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/AzurePush) can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki).

AzurePush will provide push notification functionality.  The current SDK for Azure Notification Hubs can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-notificationhubs/tree/master/iOS/WindowsAzureMessaging). The intent is to migrate that SDK to this repository, update it, and refactor the API to ensure it works seamlessly with the other SDKs in this project to provide the best possible developer experience.

More information on the features to be included in AzureData can be found the [Requirements](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/Requirements-AzurePush) wiki document.
