[AzureAuth API Reference](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/AzureAuth) and [samples](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/AzureAuth) can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki).

AzureAuth is an SDK that enables authentication with popular identity providers SDKs to be used to securely access backend services on [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview). AzureAuth will support five identity providers out of the box: Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter. Your app can use any number of these identity providers to provide your users with options for how they sign in.

Azure App Service uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider stores accounts and authenticates users. The application relies on the provider's identity information so that the app doesn't have to store that information itself. 

More information on the features to be included in AzureAuth can be found the [Requirements](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/wiki/Requirements-AzureAuth) wiki document.
